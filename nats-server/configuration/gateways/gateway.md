# Configuration

The `gateway` configuration block is similar to a `cluster` block:

```text
gateway {
    name: "A"
    listen: "localhost:7222"
    authorization {
        user: gwu
        password: gwp
    }

    gateways: [
        {name: "A", url: "nats://gwu:gwp@localhost:7222"},
        {name: "B", url: "nats://gwu:gwp@localhost:7333"},
        {name: "C", url: "nats://gwu:gwp@localhost:7444"},
    ]
}
```

One difference is that instead of `routes` you specify `gateways`. As expected _self-gateway_ connections are ignored, so you can share gateway configurations with minimal fuzz.

Starting a server:

Once all the gateways are up, these clusters of one will forward messages as expected:

```text
> nats-pub -s localhost:4444 foo bar
Published [foo] : 'bar'

# On a different session...
> nats-sub -s localhost:4333 ">"
Listening on [>]
```

## `Gateway` Configuration Block

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `advertise` | Hostport `<host>:<port>` to advertise to other gateways. |
| `authorization` | Authorization block \(same as other nats-server `authorization` configuration\). |
| `connect_retries` | Number of times the server will try to connect to a discovered gateway. |
| `gateways` | List of Gateway entries - see below. |
| `host` | Interface where the gateway will listen for incomming gateway connections. |
| `listen` | Combines `host` and `port` as `<host>:<port>` |
| `name` | Name for this cluster, all gateways belonging to the same cluster, should specify the same name. |
| `port` | Port where the gateway will listen for incomming gateway connections. |
| `reject_unknown` | If `true`, gateway will reject connections from gateways that are not configured in `gateways`. |
| `tls` | TLS configuration block \(same as other [nats-server `tls` configuration](../securing_nats/tls.md#tls-configuration)\). |

### `Gateway` Entry

The `gateways` configuration block is a list of gateway entries with the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `name` | Gateway name. |
| `url` | Hostport `<host>:<port>` describing where the remote gateway can be reached. If multiple IPs are returned, one is randomly selected. |
| `urls` | A list of `url` |

By using `urls` and an array, you can specify a list of endpoints that form part of a cluster as below. A NATS Server will pick one of those addresses randomly and only establish a single outbound gateway connection to one of the members from another cluster:

```text
gateway {
    name: "DC-A"
    listen: "localhost:7222"

    gateways: [
        {name: "DC-A", urls: ["nats://localhost:7222", "nats://localhost:7223", "nats://localhost:7224"]},
        {name: "DC-B", urls: ["nats://localhost:7332", "nats://localhost:7333", "nats://localhost:7334"]},
        {name: "DC-C", urls: ["nats://localhost:7442", "nats://localhost:7333", "nats://localhost:7335"]}
    ]
}
```
