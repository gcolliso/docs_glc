# Unsubscribing

The client libraries provide a means to unsubscribe a previous subscription request.

This process requires an interaction with the server, so for an asynchronous subscription there may be a small window of time where a message comes through as the unsubscribe is processed by the library. Ignoring that slight edge case, the client library will clean up any outstanding messages and tell the server that the subscription is no longer used.
