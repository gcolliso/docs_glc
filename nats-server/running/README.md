# Running

The nats-server has many command line options. To get started, you don't have to specify anything. In the absence of any flags, the NATS server will start listening for NATS client connections on port 4222. By default, security is disabled.

## Standalone

When the server starts it will print some information including where the server is listening for client connections:

```text
> nats-server
[41634] 2019/05/13 09:42:11.745919 [INF] Starting nats-server version 2.0.0

...

[41634] 2019/05/13 09:42:11.746252 [INF] Server is ready
```

## Docker

If you are running your NATS server in a docker container:

```text
> docker run -p 4222:4222 -ti nats:latest
