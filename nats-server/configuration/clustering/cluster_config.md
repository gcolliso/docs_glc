| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `listen` | host/port for inbound route connections |
| `authorization` | [authorization](../securing_nats/authorization.md) map for configuring cluster clients. Supports `token`, `username`/`password` and `TLS authentication`. `permissions` are ignored. |
| `timeout` | Maximum amount of time \(in seconds\) to wait for a clustering connection to complete |
| `tls` | A [`tls` configuration map](../securing_nats/tls.md#tls-configuration) for securing the clustering connection |
| `routes` | A list of other servers \(URLs\) to cluster with. Self-routes are ignored. |
